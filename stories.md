As a content creator, I have a portfolio of talks or blog posts or magazine articles or book topics; that I am comfortable with other presenters using. Let’s say one of the topics is Asynchronous PHP. I have spoken and written loads about it.

I don’t even submit the topic to conferences anymore, because I’m just so tired of presenting it myself. I still keep up with the latest async trends and I could easily mentor someone else to do a talk or write an article on the topic. 

I have optionally marked the topic as one where I could help someone else to present it, and I could also optionally mark that I will present the topic if someone requests it of me. 

I can add the topic to the site, where it can be picked up with someone else. In order for them to present on the topic (with the same name, abstract, and outline); they need to follow some ground rules. They need to mention my name and/or twitter handle within the first 5 paragraphs of text, or slides of a talk, or minutes of presentation on some other medium.

If I have specified that I do not want to mentor others on my topics, and that I do not want to present any of them again, then this is where my involvement ends.

I could still go through each, adding where I presented the topic and links to feedback for each presentation. This could become a kind of speaking portfolio. None of that’s required of me, though.

As a presenter, I want to submit proposals to conferences. Or ideas to the magazine I write for. Or talks to the local meet-up. I go to the site and look for topics I find interesting.

I find one about Asynchronous PHP, and see that the creator is willing to help me present this topic. I fill out a form, stating that I would like their help and want to present the topic. They can still decline, but in this case they don’t. I ask how they would prefer to communicate and we take things off the site from there.

I still need to obey the ground-rules they have defined, for me to be able to use this topic; the most basic of which is that I credit them.

As a publisher, I run a conference. Or publish a magazine. Or run a meet-up. I want to get more speakers or writers or whatever. I go to the site and find the topic I want. I can even filter creators by a “from an under-represented group” flag; which is something presenters can optionally specify in their accounts.

I find the topic I need, and fill in a form to request a presentation for my medium. They can accept and we can take things offline from then on. Or they decline, and my request for presentation goes through to an open list. Another presenter can pick the topic up from that list, giving them an easier way to get into the event or publication; and helping to fill my conference slots or magazine pages quicker.

This last aspect is an avenue for monetisation, as email addresses are protected by default, unless everyone involved decides their email addresses can be open to the public.
